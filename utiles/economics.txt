Glosary

-----------------------
A bailout is a colloquial term for the provision of financial help to a corporation or country which otherwise would be on the brink of failure or bankruptcy.
-----------------------
Sovereign Debt
Sovereign debt is a promise by a government to pay those who lend it money.
-----------------------
Risk and Reputation
Developing countries can be at a disadvantage when it comes to borrowing funds.
-----------------------
Countries can get out of debt three ways:
1. Pay back the debt.
2. Print money and then pay back the debt with less valuable money (works with nominal debt, but not inflation-linked debt)
3. Refuse to pay the debt and default.
-----------------------
Government debt (also known as public interest, public debt, national debt and sovereign debt)[1][2] contrasts to the annual government budget deficit, which is a flow variable that equals the difference between government receipts and spending in a single year.
